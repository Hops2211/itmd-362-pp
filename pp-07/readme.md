# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
  Aesthetic integrity.
  Usually the MyIIT Login is used for business not for fun keeping the login 
  page simple and easy to use, with no expected graphics or
  weird design implementaion

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
  Messages.
  The login page will display a plain text error message when
  the user does not type in the correct username and password

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
  Direct Manipulation.
  The login screen will turn in accorandce with the device
  as well as you will be able to zoom in and it will adjust
