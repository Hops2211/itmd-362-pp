# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: Symmetric, smooth, rounded, small enough to hold comfortably,
            nice circumfrence, bright top

* Behavioral: water doesn't come out when its tipped upside down, water comes out when squeezed or
              sucked on.

* Reflective: Well known brand (Gatorade), makes you look like an athlete

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1.  Symmetric layout so it is easy to navigate and remember
2.  Slightly rounded edges so the design doesn't look so hard
3.  Bright colors that are appealing but contrasted with an evenly darker color
