## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=51T0H0k++NqhzWHwd+E+fqcXvb5
Your Rationale: I chose a deeply saturated green and yellow. Gaming consoles usually
                have bright attractive easily distinguishable logos. As well as the games
                played on them usually include bright attractive colors. Makes you want
                to buy somthing

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3290i0kuMIhhIQEnDL6GsuyEtlV
Your Rationale: I chose a mix of light green, purple and magenta. Something that represented
                the widest range of springtime colors. Green for the grass, and the other colors
                for blooming flowers. Bright springtime colors.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=5450c0kvUosMUauDPgxr-wKmjAo
Your Rationale: A basic range of blues. Nothing fancy to distract you from the purpose of the 
                messaging. Also was stuck on the facebook messaenger

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13T0c0kYjceRlsmRlsmVT2FVT2F
Your Rationale: One basic color. I used a dark/navy blue because it represents business
                I stuck with a darker color rather than bright colors so the colors would
                not distract from the content of the page. but also dark blue rather than
                black to give the page a hint of color
